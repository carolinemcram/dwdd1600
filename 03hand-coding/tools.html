        <h1>Tools</h1>
        <p>This section introduces the tools and materials used throughout the risograph printing process.</p>
        <h2>Printing Equipment</h2>
        <dl>
            <dt>Risograph Printer Brands</dt>
            <dd>RISO is the primary manufacturer associated with risograph printing and is widely used in creative and
                educational settings. Other duplicator brands exist, but RISO machines are preferred for their ink
                system, artistic flexibility, and strong presence in design communities.</dd>
        </dl>
        <h2>Inks & Stencils</h2>
        <dl>
            <dt>Ink Drums</dt>
            <dd>Ink drums are removable components that hold a single color of ink inside the risograph machine. Each
                drum
                corresponds to one color, and printing with multiple colors requires swapping drums and running the
                paper
                through the machine multiple times.</dd>

            <dt>Soy-Based Inks</dt>
            <dd>Risograph inks are soy-based and semi-transparent, which allows colors to overlap and blend visually
                when
                layered. This translucency contributes to the distinctive color variations and textures commonly seen in
                risograph prints.</dd>

            <dt>Masters</dt>
            <dd>Masters are thin stencils created from digital artwork and wrapped around the ink drum. They control
                where
                ink is applied to the paper, and a new master must be created for each color used in a design. Over
                time,
                masters wear out and can affect print consistency.</dd>
        </dl>
        <h2>Materials & Preparation</h2>
        <dl>
            <dt>Uncoated Paper</dt>
            <dd>Uncoated paper is commonly used in risograph printing because it absorbs ink more effectively than
                coated
                paper. Paper weight, texture, and absorbency all influence how the ink spreads and how well colors align
                during multiple print passes.</dd>

            <dt>Digital Design Tools</dt>
            <dd>Digital design tools are used to prepare artwork before printing by separating colors, adjusting
                contrast,
                and creating halftones. Proper file preparation is essential to ensure that each color layer prints
                accurately when transferred onto a master.</dd>
