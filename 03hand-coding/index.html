        <h1>History</h1>
        <h2>What is a Risograph</h2>
        <p>The Risograph is a stencil duplicator. Think of it as a cross
            between screen printing and photocopying. The Risograph receives your image digitally and then makes a
            stencil by burning tiny pixelated holes into a fiber-based master. This master is then wrapped around a
            color drum that pushes the ink onto the paper, resulting in a print. This process happens one color at a
            time, so the more colors your design has, the more times your paper needs to go through the machine.</p>

        <h2>Origins of the Risograph</h2>
        <p>Invented by Noboru Hayama (founder of Riso Kagaku Corporation), The Risograph 007 printer was first released
            in Japan in August 1986.</p>

        <h2>Evolution of the Machine</h2>
        <p>While Hayama was developing the Risograph printer, he was also working on creating a new ink. Following the
            end of World War II, Japan was suffering a period of economic depression. Emulsion ink was only available
            through an expensive importing process, so, in a bid to bring a cheaper alternative to the market, Hayama
            devised a soy-based ink called <strong>“Riso”</strong> (meaning <em>“ideal”</em> in Japanese). Riso was
            ideal for high-quality color
            printing at an affordable price—not to mention it's better for the environment compared to other inks. Aside
            from its vibrant inks, the Risograph is also extremely efficient. With one push of a button, the machine can
            print between 50 and 10,000 copies within minutes.</p>

        <h2>Why the Risograph Is Used Today</h2>
        <ol>

            <li>It is ideal for posters, graphic prints, zines, comics, and other graphic arts.</li>
            <li>The <strong>Riso</strong>, even though being a digital machine, does not guarantee perfection, which
                makes each piece
                unique.</li>
            <li>It is a highly energy efficient and sustainable printing method, making for an ethical product,
                unmatched by other printing methods.</li>
            <li>The cold process consumes little energy, and the riso prints with soy based (non-toxic) inks, and
                stencils made from plant fibres. Unlike litho printing, it only takes a single print for the stencil to
                be fully inked and ready to print. It uses little electricity and eliminates the need for up to 100,000
                litres of water and 10,000 litres of alcohol (per year) consumed by a typical mid-size printer.</li>
            <li>All inks are unique to the riso process and colours produced cannot be accurately represented on the
                web, giving you unique print results.</li>
        </ol>
