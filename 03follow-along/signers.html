            </dd>

            <dt>Benjamin Franklin</dt>

                A strong advocate for independence and an influential leader in the Continental Congress. Adams later

            </dd>

            <dt>Samuel Adams</dt>

                A revolutionary leader and organizer who helped mobilize colonial resistance to British rule. He was

                public support for independence.
            </dd>

            <dt>Roger Sherman</dt>
            <dd>

                of Rights.
            </dd>

            <dt>Robert Morris</dt>
            <dd>
                Known as the “Financier of the American Revolution,” Morris used his personal wealth and financial
                expertise to help fund the Continental Army, especially during times when official funds were scarce.
            </dd>

            <dt>John Witherspoon</dt>
            <dd>
                A clergyman and educator who signed the Declaration of Independence. He served as president of the

            </dd>

            <dt>Charles Carroll of Carrollton</dt>
            <dd>
                The wealthiest signer of the Declaration and the only Catholic among them. He signed his full name to

        </dl>




        <p>Each of these individuals played a significant role in the founding of the United States and is remembered
